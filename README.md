# CalorieCompass
## Overview
Welcome to CalorieCompass, your ultimate companion on the journey towards achieving your personal health and fitness goals. This innovative web application is designed to track your daily calorie intake, ensuring you stay on the right path to nutritional wellness.

CalorieCompass is not just a simple calorie counter. It's a comprehensive tool that provides an in-depth view of your eating habits, helping you understand more about your diet and how it affects your overall health. By logging your meals, you can easily monitor your intake of not just calories, but also essential nutrients - from proteins and carbs to vitamins and minerals.

The application is designed with user-friendly features that make it easy for you to log in your daily meals. All you need to do is input the food you've consumed, and CalorieCompass will calculate the calories for you. Whether you're eating out or cooking at home, we've got you covered with our extensive database of food items and their nutritional values.

## Project Goals
This is my fourth portfolio project for Code Institute and my goal with this project is to display my newly acquired skills with frameworks such as Bootstrap and Django. I decided to build a calorie tracker webapp that fetches the information from an API website

## The Strategy Plane
CalorieCompass goal is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly app that enables users to track their nutritional intake, understand the caloric and nutritional content of foods, and suggests activities to offset caloric intake. We want to become the go-to app for individuals looking to maintain a healthy diet, lose weight, or gain insight into their eating habits.

## The Ideal User

- Someone wants to know nutrition facts about the food they eat.
- Someone wants to track sports activities needed to burn the food they ate.

## Site Goals
- Provide users to create their own profile.
- Provide users to add their daily meals.
- Provide users an interface to know nutritional facts about food.
- Provide users a graphical representation of the macro nutrients food.
- Provide users a graphical representation of their caloric intake.

## Agile planning
This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features across the duration of the project. All User Stories were assigned to Epics, prioritized under the labels, Must Have, Should Have and Could Have. They were assigned story points according to complexity. Story points were adjusted mid-project to use the common Fibonacci sequence correctly. "Must Have" stories were completed first, "Should Have's" and then finally "Could Have's".

The Kanban board was created using Github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/moabdelbasset/projects/2/views/1) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. All stories have a full set of acceptance criteria to define the functionality that marks that story as complete.
